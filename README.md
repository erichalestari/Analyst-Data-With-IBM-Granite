## About Me

As a recent graduate in Actuarial Science, I bring a solid understanding of insurance and financial principles, combined with practical data analysis skills in R, Python, and SQL. During my internship at the Central Bureau of Statistics, I worked on relevant projects including export-import forecasting and survey data analysis using SPSS and Excel. I’m well-versed in data visualization tools like ggplot2 and Excel Charts, and have experience building automation tools with VBA and Pivot Tables to streamline workflows.

Beyond technical skills, I’ve demonstrated leadership through organizational roles and entrepreneurial experience, including planning and running business initiatives such as a healthy food startup and managing my current local laundry business. I am a communicative team player who learns quickly and adapts easily to new environments. With a blend of analytical thinking, business insight, and people skills, I’m excited to grow professionally and contribute to impactful, data-driven decisions.
