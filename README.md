## About Me

As a recent graduate in Actuarial Science, I bring a solid understanding of insurance and financial principles, combined with practical data analysis skills in R, Python, and SQL. During my internship at the Central Bureau of Statistics, I worked on relevant projects including export-import forecasting and survey data analysis using SPSS and Excel. I’m well-versed in data visualization tools like ggplot2 and Excel Charts, and have experience building automation tools with VBA and Pivot Tables to streamline workflows.

Beyond technical skills, I’ve demonstrated leadership through organizational roles and entrepreneurial experience, including planning and running business initiatives such as a healthy food startup and managing my current local laundry business. I am a communicative team player who learns quickly and adapts easily to new environments. With a blend of analytical thinking, business insight, and people skills, I’m excited to grow professionally and contribute to impactful, data-driven decisions.

## Project 

### Python 
[Disaster Risk Profiling & Insurance Premium Estimation](https://github.com/erichalestari/global-risk-metrics/blob/main/Risk_Profiling_and_Insurance_Premium_Estimation.ipynb)

This project utilizes a multi-level data analysis framework to assess natural disaster risks and estimate insurance premiums based on regional vulnerability. Through exploratory data analysis and risk modeling, it identifies high-risk zones, evaluates exposure and vulnerability factors, and simulates premium costs using annual loss estimates. The results are presented with visualizations and summary tables to support insurance strategy and risk mitigation policies.

### SQL 


### R 

[Export Value Analysis Using Double Exponential Smoothing]

This project presents a time series analysis of Indonesia's export values from 2018 to 2023 using the Double Exponential Smoothing (DES) method, excluding seasonal components. Implemented in R with libraries such as readxl, forecast, and stats, the analysis reveals a consistent upward trend in export performance and generates five-period forecasts indicating gradual growth. Data visualization includes actual values, fitted trends, and forecasted points, while accuracy metrics like MAPE and MSE confirm the model's reliability for strategic planning and decision-making
